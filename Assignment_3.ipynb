    "1. What are the benefits of including roles in the programmes?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since this assignment is related to function, I assume the question is “What are the benefits of including functions \n",
    "    in the programmes?”\n",
    "\n",
    "    Functions allow us to use the same code again and again (reusability). Functions make our program easy to read, \n",

    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "    The code in function run when function is called, not when it is specified.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Function is nothing but a function definition where, set of code is written to achieve a particular result. \n",
    "    It just sits idle until it is called.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Function call is transfer of a control from main program to the start of function execution and it returns some value.\n",

    "    There is only one global scope. Variables in this scope are accessible to all the code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There can be any number of local scopes. Local scope is limited to that particular function. Variables in this scope are accessible locally only.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Return value is the value, which is the result of function execution. Yes, it possible to have a return value in \n",
    "    an expression.\n",

    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Global statement allow us to not only access the global variable but also modify them from inside the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "        *    \n",
    "        'hello' \n",
    "        -87.8 \n",

    "    Operator is a symbol which performs some computations on operands (values/variables).\n",
    "    operators = *,-,/,+\n",
    "\n",
    "    Values are the one on which operation is performed.\n",

    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "    spam \n",
    "    'spam'\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variable is the name of the location where the value of variable is stored. Here spam is variable.\n",
    "    String is a sequence of characters. String is represented in quotes. ‘spam’ is a string \n",

    "3. Describe three different data forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "        I. Numbers: integers either positive or negative\n",

    "4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Expression is combination of variables, operators and values. Expression always result in single meaningful value. \n",
    "    e.g. x = y + z /5 is an expression, which would return the value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. What's the difference between a declaration \n",
    "and an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variable declaration in python happens when you assign some value to a variable like mentioned in the question \n",
    "    spam = 10, which is a simple assignment statement assigns the value 10 to variable ‘spam’. Statement does not \n",
    "    evaluate to a single value. Whereas Expression is combination of variables, operators and values. Expression \n",
    "    always result in single meaningful value. e.g. spam = spam + 10 is an expression. \n",

    "    bacon = 22\n",
    "    bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    bacon = 22\n",
    "    bacon variable is assigned the value 22. Expression ‘bacon + 1’ is evaluated but not reassigned to bacon variable, \n",
    "    so it won’t alter the variable value. bacon will have the same value 22. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "    'spam' + 'spamspam' – This concatenates two strings and returns the string ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "    'spam' * 3 – This also returns the same string ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?\n",
    "\n",
    "      Variable name eggs contains letters which is acceptable by python interpreter whereas, 100 is number which is \n",
    "      not allowed in python (variable names cannot start with number). We can use combination of alpha-numeric like \n",
    "      eggs100 can be a true variable name. \n",

    "string?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Function int() converts value to a integer value. e.g. function int(123.4) convert floating point number 123.4 to an \n",
    "    integer 123.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Function float() converts value to a floating point value. e.g. function float(56) convert number 56 to a floating         point number 56.0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Function str() converts value to a string value. e.g. function str(78) convert number 78 to a string i.e. ‘78’.\n",

    "10. What is the error caused by this expression? What would you do about it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' \n",
    "\n",
    "    This expression gave a TypeError. It means only strings can be concatenated together. Integer and string cannot\n",

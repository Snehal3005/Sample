    "\n",
    "    An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword “yield” instead of returning it in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function.  It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory.\n",

    "3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list.\n",

    "\n",
    "    a. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required).\n",
